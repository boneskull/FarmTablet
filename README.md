# Farm Tablet - A Stardew Valley Mod

> A portable Farm Computer

## What is this?

This mod adds a new tool to the game: the **iFarmer**. ![This is what it looks like](assets/tablet.png)

When you use the **iFarmer**, it does the same thing that a [Farm Computer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farm_Computer) does.

_However_, unlike a Farm Computer, the **iFarmer** is _portable_.

_Yes_, your dreams _have_ come true.

## How do I get an iFarmer?

Once you've unlocked the Farm Computer, the **iFarmer** is purchaseable from Robin for 20,000g.

This is only the default behavior, and can be changed via the mod configuration.

## Configuration

You can configure this mod by editing the `config.json` file in the mod's folder, or (recommended) by using [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098).

### Configuration Options

- `RequireFarmComputerRecipe` (default: `true`): If `false`, then the **iFarmer** will be available for purchase from Robin from the start of the game.

## Requirements

[SMAPI](https://smapi.io) v3.0.0+
